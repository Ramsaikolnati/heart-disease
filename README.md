# Heart Disease Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of a patient having **heart disease** based on medical attributes such as cholesterol level, blood pressure, age, and other factors. The aim is to provide an **assistive diagnostic tool** for healthcare professionals.

## 🗂 Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle Heart Disease Dataset  
- **Features:** Age, sex, chest pain type, resting BP, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, ECG results, max heart rate, exercise-induced angina, etc.  
- **Target:** Presence of heart disease (1 = yes, 0 = no)

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, TensorFlow/Keras, Seaborn

## 🔍 Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing data, encode categorical variables.
2. **EDA:** Analyze feature distribution, detect outliers.
3. **Feature Scaling:** Normalize numerical features.
4. **Model Training:** Train and compare Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and CNN models.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
